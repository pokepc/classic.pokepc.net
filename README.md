Source code for SuperEffective's website.

Data can be found in https://github.com/itsjavi/supereffective/tree/main/src/lib/data-client

## Prerequisites

You will need Docker (for the local DB and mail server), Node v20 LTS and pnpm v8.

## Quick Start

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `pnpm install`
3. Run the website in development mode: run any of: `pnpm dev`.
4. Open http://localhost:3001 or run `pnpm open` to open the website in your browser.
5. You can register with any email. Emails will be logged in the console and also stored under `./local/mails`.

Or all in one command: `pnpm build && pnpm dev && pnpm open`

For other scripts, please check the `package.json` files.

## Software Stack

We use the following technologies, services and tools:

- We use Node v20 LTS
- pnpm v8 for package management
- Turborepo (turbo) to accelerate running scripts
- NextJS 14 + React 18 for the website
- CSS Modules for styling without styling libraries
- React Context for state management (to be replaced by Redux Toolkit or Zustand)
- MDX + [FrontMater CMS](https://frontmatter.codes/) as the local/static CMS
- Next Auth, Prisma and Neon.tech PostgreSQL for authentication and dex data storage
- Vercel (Pro tier) for hosting and deployments
- GitHub for hosting static JSON dataset
- CloudFlare for caching and DNS
- Docker, PostgreSQL and Maildev for local development environment
- Other tools: ESLint, Prettier, Husky, etc.

## Project Structure

This project is a NextJS application with the following directory structure:

- `blogs`: the MDX content of the website pages
- `public`: static assets (for the UI and also for the CMS pages)
- `scripts`: Maintenance or development scripts
- `src`:
  - `app`: Next.js App Router
  - `components`: general reusable components
  - `config`: general app config (e.g. from env vars, json files or ts code)
  - `features/{name}/`: business logic in bounded contexts, following some DDD principles
    - `components`: components specific to this domain
    - `hooks`: hooks specific to this domain
    - `state`: domain state: contexts, objects and types
    - `views`: domain views: views composed with many other components
    - `lib`: services and utilities specific to this domain
  - `hooks`: generic hooks
  - `lib`: generic libraries and services, or services that are not specific to a domain
    - `data-client`: helpers to fetch the static data from the dataset CDN, and types
    - `mailer`: mail client abstraction supporting `local-fs` and `resend.com`
    - `mdx`: helpers to extract and load MDX content from a directory
    - `patreon`: Patreon API client abstraction

### Submitting changes to the dataset

The data used in this project can be found as
[minified JSON files](https://github.com/itsjavi/supereffective/tree/main/src/lib/data-client) in the
`src/lib/data-client` folder of the project. Feel free to report data issues, suggest improvements and changes, or
submit a pull request with the changes or fixes.

Basic instructions:

- Edit/add games: the will need to be added in `legacy-games.json` and `legacy-gamesets.json` (if needed), with all the
  necessary data.
- Edit/add Pokémon: the will need to be added in `legacy-pokemon.json` and then minified to `legacy-pokemon.min.json`.
- Edit/add Box Presets: the will need to be added in `box-presets/by-gameset` and then bundled to
  `box-presets/legacy-boxpresets.min.json` by calling `npx -y tsx run src/lib/data-client/box-presets/join-presets.ts`
  or `bun run src/lib/data-client/box-presets/join-presets.ts`.

> NOTE: when editing the `legacy-pokemon.json` file, you will need to run `pnpm build:data:pokemon` to minify the file.
> After editing any JSON data file, run a final `pnpm build:data` to make sure everything else is correctly built.
